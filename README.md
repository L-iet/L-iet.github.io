## Interview Questions
**What skills and experiences are you hoping to take away from this program? How does this align with your personal and professional interests and goals?**

By the end of this program, I hope to gain more understanding of web development. I also look forward to working with a team and hope to improve my collaboration skills. Finally, I hope to contribute to someone's knowledge by teaching them some of what I already know. I hope to get into a software engineering career in the future, and much later a research career, and I believe collaboration will be highly key to my success.


**How can websites or applications promote activism or support a community or cause? Share a specific example of a website that does this and why you picked it.**

Change.org is a website dedicated to broadcasting and empowering petitions to get solutions from decision makers. In 2022, Nigerian students in public universities could not attend university because the government and academic staff could not reach a compromise on the compensation for academic staff. Petitions were began and I signed one on Change.org, and later that year (about October), the universities were reopened. This is why I picked Change.org; I feel it has been effective in spreading the word of issues plaguing our society and getting people to take action.

**If you are unsure about a concept or run into a bug, how might you go about asking for help? Be specific. Who would you ask and why? How might you phrase your questions?**

The first step I take is to just Google for an initial solution. Knowing how to actually search online is key. Include keywords, for instance, if searching for what the `open` function does in python, your search should include "open", "function" and "python". Very often, we find useful information online.
The next step is to ask a peer or colleague. Even if they do not know the answer, they get to learn as well when we eventually find out.

My final step is to ask a professional or someone like a teaching assistant. Again, being specific about the bug is key. I once asked a professor on what python library he suggests I use to train a named-entity recognition machine learning model.

**What are 3 questions you would ask your mentor and why?**

- Why did you get into the industry?
- What do you wish you did differently?
- What other field are you interested in, and as follow up, have you thought of ways to integrate your current field with that?

The answers to these questions will help me avoid some mistakes I might currently face, and help me stay accountable to myself and remain self-aware of why I actually want to get into this software engineering.
